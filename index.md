## Welcome to myWriteup!

Hi there!

Brief intro about me; 
I am just a newbie in Infosec Industry, Capture-the-flag and also, in doing boxes on Hackthebox. 
I want to focus on DFIR but also, wants to learn some pentesting approaches, methodologies and techniques.

Actually this is my first writeup of all the three (3) machines i have owned. 

I hope you will enjoy this and also, please correct me if there are some things that i have misunderstood or please do
feel to teach me about the concepts because it will help me a lot. Thanks
